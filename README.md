# Josh's Archive of Old Programming!

This repository is an archive and chronicle of my old programming throughout the years, *before* I started doing it as a career!

There are generally 3 epochs in my amateur programming life: young childhood, high school, and college.  These are uniquely broken out by language used at that time.

## BASIC

Starting around age 8-14 (1987-1993), I primarilly dabbled with [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) on an [Apple IIe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe). 

I have old floppies with a bunch of BASIC programs. Restoration of the disks has not been attempted yet!

## Pascal

See the [Pascal notes](Pascal/README.md).

In sophomore through senior grades in high school, I took programming classes that featured [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)) on [PS/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_System/2) computers using [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal). 

SourceForge makes it easy to start using Turbo Pascal by providing a [Turbo Pascal (with DosBox)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/turbopascal-wdb/) download. Check out these retro projects today.

## C/C++

In college, I took classes in C/C++, Visual Basic, RPG, COBOL, HTML, and more. But the most memorable was C/C++. 

We used [Turbo C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_C%2B%2B). You can download a version of [Turbo C++ for modern PCs](http://www.developerinsider.in/turbocpp/) to check out these projects.
