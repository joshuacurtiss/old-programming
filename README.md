# Josh's Archive of Old Programming

This repository is an archive and chronicle of my old programming throughout the years,
*before* I started doing it as a career!

There are generally 3 epochs in my amateur programming life: young childhood, high school,
and college.  These are uniquely broken out by language used at that time.

## BASIC

Starting around age 8-14 (1987-1993), I primarily dabbled with
[BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) on an
[Apple IIe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe).

I have old floppies with a bunch of BASIC programs. Restoration of the disks has not been
attempted yet!

## Pascal

In sophomore through senior grades in high school, I took programming classes that
featured [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)) on
[PS/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_System/2) computers using
[Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal).

SourceForge makes it easy to start using Turbo Pascal by providing a
[Turbo Pascal (with DosBox)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/turbopascal-wdb/) download.
Check out these retro projects today.

## C/C++

In college, I took classes in C/C++, Visual Basic, RPG, COBOL, HTML, and more. But the
most memorable was C/C++.

We used [Turbo C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_C%2B%2B). You can download a
version of [Turbo C++ for modern PCs](http://www.developerinsider.in/turbocpp/) to check
out these projects.
